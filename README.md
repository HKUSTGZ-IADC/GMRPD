# Wheelchair Dataset

This is an RGB-D dataset of drivable area and road anomaly segmentation for robotic wheelchairs. There are a total of 3036 RGB-D images with hand-labeled segmentation ground truth, which cover 30 common scenes where robotic wheelchairs usually work (e.g., sidewalks and squares) and 18 different kinds of road anomalies that robotic wheelchairs may encounter in real environments. The total dataset is seperated into three small datasets, each of which contains 10 scenes.

The new dataset that contains 3896 RGB-D images with hand-labeled ground truth will be uploaded soon.

Now there are a total of 2883 RGB-D images with hand-labelled ground truth for segmentation in the old dataset, which are with the image resolution of 1280x720 pixels. RGB images, depth images and labels are stored in "RGB", "Depth" and "Label" folder, respectively.
