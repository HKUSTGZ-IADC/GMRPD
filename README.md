# Wheelchair Dataset

This is an RGB-D dataset of drivable area and road anomaly segmentation for robotic wheelchairs. The link of the dataset is https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Qf4qd-jvmUebUQX11qcG8z2-QZfgtKzi.

The new dataset that contains 3896 RGB-D images with hand-labeled ground truth will be uploaded soon.

Now there are a total of 2883 RGB-D images with hand-labelled ground truth for segmentation in the old dataset, which are with the image resolution of 1280x720 pixels. RGB images, depth images and labels are stored in "RGB", "Depth" and "Label" folder, respectively.
